Let danger befall him. Let the winds of fate blow where they may.
Andre Moreau(Stewart Granger) will strike a blow for vengeance and the
French Revolution.

First he must hone his skill with the blade. By day Andre secretly perfects
his parries and lunges - and hides his true identity at night behind the
mask of stage clown Scaramouche.

A climactic duel that's one of the greatest sequences ever to lay steel to
foe caps this bravura adaptation of the Rafael Sabatini novel.

George Sidney nimbly directs all the swordplay wordplay and horseplay.

Also featuring: Eleanor Parker, Janet Leigh and Mel Ferrer.

En garde!

Enjoy the movie!
